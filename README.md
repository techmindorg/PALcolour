# PALcolour
Software to perform colourisation of digitised analogue PAL composite video images (may do NTSC in future too). Sometimes called a "comb filter" but personally I don't like that description.

Initial upload is just the core .cpp file (to expedite forking into another project), though in the coming week or two I hope to upload the native Borland C++ Builder v6.0 project and supporting files.

I fully acknowledge that the code as-supplied is very much "proof of principle" quality. It's evolved over 20 years. It's not elegant code, it's barely structured, and has next to no error-checking (which is partly why I'm holding back on uploading the whole project just yet). But it does do quite a nice job of decoding colour.
