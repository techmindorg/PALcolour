# PALcolour
Software to perform colourisation of digitised analogue PAL composite video images (may do NTSC in future too). Sometimes called a "comb filter" but personally I don't like that description.

Initial upload is just the core .cpp file (to expedite forking into another project), though in the coming week or two I hope to upload the native Borland C++ Builder v6.0 project and supporting files.
